+++

I am Jugal Kishore, 24 years old Software Developer. I am proficient in Python, Golang, BASH, and currently learning Kubernetes. Currently working at **[picoNETS](https://piconets.com/)** as **Junior Software/Backend Developer**. An open minded, passionate guy. I love to learn new things and technology all the time with passion. My work for now basically is scattered between various languages, but all of it can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/crazyuploader) profile. My latest résumé can be found ~~here~~.

You can find me on [Telegram](https://t.me/crazyuploader) as it is my primary social platform.

Being limited on internet, I use CI extensively to have my day-to-day things such as updating
[Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/u/crazyuploader), or pulling some latest [Toolchains](https://github.com/crazyuploader/Clang-Toolchain). I believe in automation so much so that I ended up making few of my reposotories fully automated.

Linux is my primary choice when it comes to Operating System, with Ubuntu being my primary Distro. Though, I have dualbooted my system along with Windows 10.
